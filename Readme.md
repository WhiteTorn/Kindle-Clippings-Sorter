# Kindle Clippings Sorter

this script allows you to sort clippings from kindle.

**first** you get text file from kindle , which should be named clippings.txt. 
after that you change name of the file in file_reader.py (default name is test to test if script works)
and everything is done.


## ⚠⚠⚠ Some bugs and issues
- This script can't read russian and other languages which had different encoding system , I can't fix it so if you know sollution make pull request to improve project.
- I think script can't convert big files.

good luck.
