А знание это я не приобрел ни- чем, но оно дано мне вместе со всеми, дано потому, что я ниоткуда не мог взять его. Откуда взял я это? Разумом, что ли, дошел я до того, что надо любить ближнего и не душить его? Мне сказали это в детстве, и я радостно пове- рил, потому что мне сказали то, что было у меня в душе. А кто открыл это? Не разум. Разум открыл борьбу за существование и закон, требующий того, чтобы душить всех, мешающих удовлетворению моих желаний. Это вывод разума. А любить другого не мог открыть разум, потому что это неразум- но".

Recall how it felt when anyone older and bigger than you sought to control you, as if age and size were identical with authority. At one time or another, your parents, teachers, coaches, scoutmasters, and clergy would all take advantage of their position to invade your private life, impose their expectations on your future, and enforce your conformity to past standards. Whenever these adults substituted their hopes, dreams, and desires for your own, they were doing so, by their account, “for your own good” or “with your best interests at heart.” And while sometimes this was true, we all remember those other times when it wasn’t—when “because I said so” wasn’t enough and “you’ll thank me one day” rang hollow.

Here we see the hierarchic nature of a complex system. A personal computer functions properly only because of the collaborative activity of each of its major parts. Together, these separate parts logically form a whole. Indeed, we can reason about how a computer works only because we can decompose it into parts that we can study separately. Thus, we may study the operation of a monitor independently of the operation of the hard disk drive. Similarly, we may study the ALU without regard for the primary memory subsystem.

Hierarchic systems are usually composed of only a few different kinds of subsystems in various combinations and arrangements. [11] In other words, complex systems have common patterns. These patterns may involve the reuse of small components, such as the cells found in both plants and animals, or of larger structures, such as vascular systems, also found in both plants and animals.

“The nature of abstractions that may be achieved through the use of procedures is well suited to the description of abstract operations, but is not particularly well suited to the description of abstract objects. This is a serious drawback, for in many applications, the complexity of the data objects to be manipulated contributes substantially to the overall complexity of the problem” [5].

For this reason, the physical structure of a small to moderate-sized object-oriented application appears as a graph, not as a tree, which is typical of algorithmically oriented languages. Additionally, there is little or no global data. Instead, data and operations are united in such a way that the fundamental logical building blocks of our systems are no longer algorithms, but instead are classes and objects.

Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships.

(1) Object-oriented programming uses objects, not algorithms, as its fundamental logical building blocks (the “part of” hierarchy we introduced in Chapter 1); (2) each object is an instance of some class; and (3) classes may be related to one another via inheritance relationships (the “is a” hierarchy we spoke of in Chapter 1).
